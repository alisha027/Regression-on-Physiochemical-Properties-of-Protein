# 🧬 Protein Physicochemical Property Analysis

This project focuses on computing and analyzing various physicochemical properties of protein sequences using Python and bioinformatics tools. These properties are essential for understanding protein structure, function, and interactions.

## 📌 Objectives

- Extract protein sequences and compute relevant physicochemical properties.
- Utilize `ProtParam` from Biopython to obtain detailed protein features.
- Lay groundwork for potential use in machine learning applications, such as protein classification or structure prediction.

## 🧪 Features Extracted

- Molecular weight
- Amino acid composition
- Instability index
- Aromaticity
- Isoelectric point (pI)
- Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY)


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Biopython (ProtParam)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
